The file describes simulation steps

1.  In this step video is prepared for “simulation transmission”. It consists of processing source video file by FFMpeg tool in order to achieve the same I, P, and B frames order i.e. the same GoP as in the experimental case. In this way we provide matching between real degradation and degradation that must be generated in the simulation case [31]
2.	In this step the next command must be performed: ./MP4Box.exe –hint –mtu 1356 –fps 25 –add OK720.mp4 RTP70.mp4. In this step video file OK720.mp4 is being prepared for delivering.
3.	In this step we create video trace file by the next command: ./mp4trace.exe –F–s 192.168.1.1 12345 RTP720.mp4 > RTP720.st
4.	In this step in NS2 we performed: ns wired.tcl
5.	In this step we compare the sent video file with the received one in order to get the video content with disruption: ./etmp4.exe –F –0 sd rd RTP720.st RTP720.mp4 Greska.mp4
6.	After processing of video file RTP720 we got Greska.mp4 and we need to compare it with the original video file OK720.mp4 by VQMT tool in order to get SSIM values.
